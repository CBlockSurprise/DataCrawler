# DataCrawler
*Only works on MacOS so far.*

Looks through all files on a computer, and finds all of the keyword related files.

**C# project is [idontknow](https://github.com/jaideng1/DataCrawler/tree/master/idontknow)** *(i didn't know what i was going to make at the time.)*

# Running
Create a file in Documents called 'x.txt', or just download [this](https://github.com/jaideng1/DataCrawler/blob/master/x.txt) file.

Next, open it up in Visual Studio. Edit the variable ***computerUsername*** (at the top) and replace it with the username of your account.

It should work now if you run it, but if you have many files, it will take hours. If you have a computer with a very small amount of files, it'll run fast.

You might want to clone this, and change the index.html words, but you will need to change the website it requests the words from in the C#.

# You have to have a internet connection to run it.
