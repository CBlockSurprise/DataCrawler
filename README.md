# DataCrawler
*Only works on mac so far.*

Looks through all files on a computer, and finds all of the keyword related files.

**C# project is [idontknow](https://github.com/CBlockSurprise/DataCrawler/tree/master/idontknow)** *(i didn't know what i was going to make at the time.)*

# Running
Just open it up in visual studio, and create a file in documents called 'x.txt', or just use [this]() file.
